# ue5-internal-base

# How to get the dll?
Open the .sln file
Go Up and put Release x64
Click on compile solution and you will have your dll to inject with an injector

# How to Make It Work?
You will have to dump the game with dumper-7 and change the SDK and change the 3 offsets at the beginning, i.e. UWorld, NamePool, ObjectArray. so everything will work on your game.

# What does it contain?
the base has some really basic functions:
Aimbot
Exp ( Skeleton, Name, Box )
Exploits ( Fov Changer, fly hack, speed hack etc... )

I hope this helps someone understand UE5
