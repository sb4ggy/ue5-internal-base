# How to Make It Work?
You will have to dump the game with dumper-7 and change the SDK and change the 3 offsets at the beginning, i.e. UWorld, NamePool, ObjectArray. 
After this you will have to change the offsets of: post_render_index and process_event_index.
Now compile and enjoy

# What does it contain?
the base has some really basic functions:
Aimbot,
Esp ( Skeleton, Name, Box ),
Exploits ( Fov Changer, fly hack, speed hack etc... )
